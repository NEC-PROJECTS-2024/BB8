Introduction:


Solar radiation, serving as Earth's main energy source exerts a profound influence on various natural phenomena. 
Its impact extends across weather and climate patterns, hydrological cycles, photosynthesis in vegetation, and the equilibrium of surface radiation. 
For this reason, the solar industry and climate research depend heavily on precise solar radiation forecasts. To forecast and compare solar radiation values, 
we built twelve machine-learning models. Then, we used the best of these algorithms to create a stacking model that predicted solar radiation. 
The findings demonstrate the critical role that meteorological parameters—like temperature, humidity, time, wind direction, and pressure—play in Machine learning models. 
Research investigating the correlation between land surface temperature and solar radiation levels underscored the pivotal role of solar radiation in exacerbating catastrophic climate events.
Various predictive models, including extreme gradient lifting (XGBoost), gradient boosting regression tree (GBRT), Extra tree regression, Gaussian process regression (GPR), Support vector machine(SVM), 
Bagging regressor, and random forest, were employed to forecast solar radiation levels. A stacking model combining GBRT, XGBoost, Bagging regressor, Extra tree regression, and random forest models outperformed individual models in solar radiation prediction.
